# Intro
Nim is played starting with piles or rows of objects. 
Players take turns taking any number of objects from one of the piles. Whoever takes the last of the objects win!
## Background
I wrote code to help the comptuer to learn the winning strategy after playing thousands of games against itself.
The game is such that if played correctly, the first player can always win!
